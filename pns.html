    <h1>How to Ensure Privacy</h1>
    <div id="article">


    <br>
    <p>Make sure websites are secure</p>
    <p1>You can instantly tell if any website is safe by looking for one letter: “s.” Every website address starts with the letters “http,” but you know a site is secure when you see “https.” That means the website itself is taking measures to keep users and their information secure while they use the site.

If you’re directed to any websites for school or entertainment that don’t have that extra “s” at the beginning of the address, steer clear.</p1>

    <br>
    <p>Guard personal information</p>
    <p1>This can get tricky when your child needs to be identified for schoolwork or classroom discussions, but personal details need to be guarded closely.

        Chances are, your child probably already has a student identification number. Those kinds of identifiers are a great way to protect personal details from leaking on the internet.
        
        None of the following information should be used to identify your child in class, on a list of posted grades, or in an online discussion.
        
        Full first and last name
        Social security number
        Birthdate
        Address
        Phone number
        Photograph
        Your little one should also have a secure username and password to log into courses, lectures, and assignments.</p1>

    <br>
    <p>Keep everything updated</p>
    <p1>It seems too simple to be so effective, but one of the best ways to keep kids safe online is to make sure that all devices, software, and firmware are up to date. 

        Updates can seem like a pain, but one of the biggest reasons companies come out with new versions is to deploy security patches that address the most recent and innovative threats out there. 
        
        Plus, an outdated operating system or old version of software can render your parental controls and privacy settings useless. </p1>

    <br>
    <p>Keep Your Privacy Settings On</p>
    <p1>Marketers love to know all about you, and so do hackers. Both can learn a lot from your browsing and social media usage. But you can take charge of your information. As noted by Lifehacker, both web browsers and mobile operating systems have settings available to protect your privacy online. Major websites like Facebook also have privacy-enhancing settings available. These settings are sometimes (deliberately) hard to find because companies want your personal information for its marketing value. Make sure you have enabled these privacy safeguards, and keep them enabled.</p1>
